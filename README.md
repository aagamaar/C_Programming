_ C PROGRAMMING _

C is a structured programming language. It is also known as "function orientated programming language" . 

C programming language was developed in the year of 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in the USA (AT & T).

In the year of 1968, research was started by Dennis Ritchie on programming languages like BCPL, CPL. 

The main aim of his research was to develop a new language to create an OS called UNIX'.

Referred as the "mother of all programming languages" because it influenced many modern programming languages like C++, Java, Python and Go.

C programs are platform-independent i.e. code can be compiled and run on different systems with minimal modifications.

Does not require heavy runtime environments or libraries, making it ideal for low-resource systems.
